iOS App Build Instructions
==========================

This document explains how to build your iOS app from the Python Kivy code.

Prerequisites:
-------------

1. macOS computer (required for iOS development)
2. Xcode installed from the App Store
3. Python 3.8 or higher
4. Kivy and other dependencies

Steps to Build iOS App:
----------------------

1. Install Kivy and dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements_kivy.txt

2. Install kivy-ios toolchain:
   pip install kivy-ios

3. Build the distribution:
   toolchain build python3 kivy

4. Create the Xcode project:
   toolchain create cardreader /path/to/your/project

5. Open the generated Xcode project:
   open cardreader-ios/cardreader.xcodeproj

6. Configure the project in Xcode:
   - Set your development team
   - Configure app signing
   - Set device orientation (Portrait recommended)

7. Connect your iOS device and build/run the app

Important Notes:
---------------

1. Tesseract OCR might not work directly on iOS due to system limitations
2. You may need to replace Tesseract with a cloud-based OCR service for iOS
3. Camera functionality needs to be properly implemented for iOS
4. App Store submission requires additional steps and compliance checks

Alternative Approach:
--------------------

For a simpler approach, consider using BeeWare (Toga) which provides better iOS support:
1. Install Toga: pip install toga
2. Create a Toga-based interface
3. Use Briefcase for packaging: pip install briefcase
4. Build with: briefcase build iOS
