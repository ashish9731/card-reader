macOS Application Build Instructions
==================================

This document explains how to build a native macOS application from your Python Streamlit code.

Prerequisites:
-------------

1. macOS 10.13 or later
2. Python 3.7 or higher
3. Xcode command line tools (install with: xcode-select --install)

Steps to Build macOS App:
------------------------

1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install py2app (macOS app builder):
   pip install py2app

3. Run the build script:
   ./build_macos.sh

   OR manually build with:
   python setup_macos.py py2app

4. The built app will be located in the 'dist' folder:
   dist/Smart Visiting Card Reader.app

5. To run the app:
   - Double-click the .app file in Finder
   - OR run from terminal: open dist/"Smart Visiting Card Reader.app"

Important Notes:
---------------

1. The first build will take some time as it needs to collect all dependencies
2. Subsequent builds will be faster
3. If you encounter issues with Tesseract, you may need to install it separately:
   brew install tesseract

4. For a standalone app that doesn't require Python to be installed on the target machine,
   use the alias option:
   python setup_macos.py py2app --alias

Troubleshooting:
---------------

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure all required packages are installed:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. If you get permission errors, try running with sudo:
   sudo python setup_macos.py py2app

3. If the app fails to launch, check the console logs:
   Console.app -> Search for your app name

Distribution:
------------

To distribute your app:

1. The .app file in the dist folder can be distributed directly
2. Users may need to allow apps from unidentified developers:
   System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General -> Allow apps downloaded from
